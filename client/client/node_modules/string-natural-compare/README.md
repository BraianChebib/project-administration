Compare alphanumeric strings the same way a human would, using a natural order algorithm (originally known as the [alphanum algorithm](http://davekoelle.com/alphanum.html)) where numeric characters are sorted based on their numeric values rather than their ASCII values.

```
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

This module exports a function that returns a number indicating whether one string should come before, after, or is the same as another string.
It can be used directly with the native [`.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) array method.

### Fast and Robust

This module can compare strings containing any size of number and is heavily tested with a custom [benchmark suite](https://github.com/nwoltman/string-natural-compare/tree/master/benchmark) to make sure that it is as fast as possible.
